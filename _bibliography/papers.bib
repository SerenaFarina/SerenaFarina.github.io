  title={Toward ultra-fast time-correlated single-photon counting: A compact module to surpass the pile-up limit},
  author={Farina, Serena and Acconcia, Giulia and Labanca, Ivan and Ghioni, Massimo and Rech, Ivan},
  abstract={Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC) is an excellent technique used in a great variety of scientific experiments to acquire exceptionally fast and faint light signals. Above all, in Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM), it is widely recognized as the gold standard to record sub-nanosecond transient phenomena with picosecond precision. Unfortunately, TCSPC has an intrinsic limitation: to avoid the so-called pile-up distortion, the experiments have been historically carried out, limiting the acquisition rate below 5% of the excitation frequency. In 2017, we demonstrated that such a limitation can be overcome if the detector dead time is exactly matched with the excitation period, thus paving the way to unprecedented speedup of FLIM measurements. In this paper, we present the first single-channel system that implements the novel proposed methodology to be used in modern TCSPC experimental setups. To achieve this goal, we designed a compact detection head, including a custom single-photon avalanche diode externally driven by a fully integrated Active Quenching Circuit (AQC), featuring a finely tunable dead time and a short reset time. The output timing signal is extracted by using a picosecond precision Pick-Up Circuit (PUC) and fed to a newly developed timing module consisting of a mixed-architecture Fast Time to Amplitude Converter (F-TAC) followed by high-performance Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Data are transmitted in real-time to a Personal Computer (PC) at USB 3.0 rate for specific and custom elaboration. Preliminary experimental results show that the new TCSPC system is suitable for implementing the proposed technique, achieving, indeed, high timing precision along with a count rate as high as 40 Mcps.},

  author={Farina, Serena and Labanca, Ivan and Acconcia, Giulia and Ghezzi, Alberto and Farina, Andrea and D’Andrea, Cosimo and Rech, Ivan},
  abstract={One of the major drawbacks of time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) is generally represented by pile-up distortion, which strongly bounds the maximum acquisition speed to a few percent of the laser excitation rate. Based on a previous theoretical analysis, recently we presented the first, to the best of our knowledge, low-distortion and high-speed TCSPC system capable of overcoming the pile-up limitation by perfectly matching the single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) dead time to the laser period. In this work, we validate the proposed system in a standard fluorescence measurement by comparing experimental data with the reference theoretical framework. As a result, a count rate of 32 Mc/s was achieved with a single-channel system still observing a negligible lifetime distortion.},

  author={Farina,Serena and Labanca, Ivan and Acconcia, Giulia and Ghioni, Massimo and Rech, Ivan},
  abstract={The reduction of detector dead time represents an enabling factor in several photon counting applications. In this work, we investigate the free-running operation of reach-through single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) at ultra-low dead times. By employing a fast active quenching circuit with direct bonding to the detector, we are able to achieve a 10 ns dead time with a thick SPAD by Excelitas, still maintaining extremely low afterpulsing probabilities (below 1.5%).},

  abstract={Timing measurements triggered by photo-detection are widely used in several different fields, such as Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) or Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems. All these applications have in common one essential element, i.e. the timing electronics, which aims at measuring the time interval between two instants and whose requirements strictly depend on the application-specific goal. In this work, we present a versatile and fully-integrated timing chip hosting eight high-performance Time-to-Amplitude Converters (TACs) integrated with a smart logic, providing to the end user a unique flexibility to select the most suitable configuration for its specific requirements.},

  title={A 1.9 ps-rms precision time-to-amplitude converter with 782 fs lsb and 0.79\%-rms dnl},
  author={Acconcia, Giulia and Malanga, Francesco and Farina, Serena and Ghioni, Massimo and Rech, Ivan},
  abstract={Measuring a time interval in the nanoseconds range has opened the way to 3-D imaging, where additional information as distance of objects light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or lifetime decay fluorescence-lifetime imaging (FLIM) is added to spatial coordinates. One of the key elements of these systems is the time measurement circuit, which encodes a time interval into digital words. Nowadays, most demanding applications, especially in the biological field, require time-conversion circuits with a challenging combination of performance, including sub-ps resolution, ps precision, several ns of measurement range, linearity better than few percent of the bin width (especially when complex lifetime data caused by multiple factors have to be retrieved), and operating rates in the order of tens of Mcps. In this article, we present a time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) implemented in a SiGe 350 nm process featuring a resolution of 782 fs, a minimum timing jitter as low as 1.9 ps-rms, a DNL down to 0.79% LSB-rms, and conversion rate as high as 12.3 Mcps. With an area occupation of 0.2 mm2 [without PADs and digital-to-analog converter (DAC)], a FSR up to 100 ns, and a power dissipation of 70 mW, we developed a circuit suitable to be the core element of a densely integrated, faster and high-performance system.},

  abstract = {With the recent advancements in single-photon detectors, very low-jitter timing systems are required to fully exploit their performance in real applications. In this article, we present the design principles and experimental characterization of a single-channel time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system, that achieves a jitter down to 4.5 ps FWHM, a peak-to-peak differential nonlinearity of 1.5% LSB and a count rate of 12 Mcps over a nanoseconds full-scale range. These results have been attained by minimizing the different jitter contributions that are introduced at various levels in the whole timing chain, still without trading them off with the other performance parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the state-of-the-art performance in case of a full-scale range as large as 12.5 ns.},

  abstract ={Metis, one of the instruments of the ESA mission Solar Orbiter (launched on 10 February 2020, from Cape Canaveral), is a coronagraph with 2 channels, capable of performing broadband polarization imaging in the visible range (580 to 640nm), and narrow-band imaging in UV (HI Lyman-α 121.6nm). It is equipped with two detectors based on CMOS APS sensors: the visible channel includes a custom CMOS sensor with direct illumination, while the UV channel is provided with an intensified camera, based on a Star-1000 rad-hard CMOS APS coupled via a 2:1 fiber optic taper to a single-stage Microchannel Plate intensifier coated with an opaque KBr photocathode and sealed with an entrance MgF2 window. Dark subtraction is a crucial step in the data reduction pipeline, thus requiring careful in-flight monitoring and characterization of the dark signal. Since it is not possible to directly acquire dark images with the visible detector, as the door of the instrument is not light-tight, an ad hoc procedure has been designed to estimate the correction to be applied. In the case of the UV detector, however, it is possible to acquire dark frames by turning off the intensifier. Due to small fluctuations occurring on the bias signal level even on short timescales, an algorithm has been developed to correct the dark matrix frame by frame.},

  abstract={Microchannel plates-based detectors have been for a long time the detectors of choice for astronomical applications in the FUV/EUV, due to their photon counting capability and the possibility of solar blindness. In the framework of technological R&D for a future astronomical FUV/EUV spectrograph, we are developing a new readout system to allow unprecedented dynamic range. The goal is to realize a photon counting, solar blind, UV detector, based on a MCP read out with a 2D anode array integrated in a custom designed Read Out Integrated Circuit (MIRA: Microchannel plate Readout ASIC), able to reach unprecedented performance in terms of dynamic range combined with spatial resolution close to 30μm. Each pixel contains an anode to collect the electrons emitted by the MCP, a low noise amplifier and filter to maximize the SNR, a comparator to recognize and count single photon events, logic to correct for charge sharing among pixels (CSCL) and two counters. Some preliminary characterization of the first prototype, based on a demonstrator of the MIRA ASIC, 32×32 pixels, 35×35μm2 size, for a total chip area of 2×2mm2, integrated into a standard demountable MCP intensifier, have been carried out.},
